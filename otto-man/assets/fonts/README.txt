Please download a medieval font (e.g., Cinzel, MedievalSharp) and place it in this folder.
Rename the font file to: main_font.ttf

The game theme is configured to look for "res://assets/fonts/main_font.ttf".
If this file is missing, the default font will be used (or you might see errors in the editor).
